# bad_advice
A terminal-based program made to give you bad advice. That's all. 

This was mainly written as a joke, but also because I wanted something to work on with Rust. It's really simple, but I thought it was funny.
It was made to work on Linux, but I'm sure you could run it from source using Cargo on Linux.

# Instructions
  -Download the latest version under "releases"__
  -Put the file under your /home directory.__
  -Execute it with "./bad_advice_rs"__

However, if you want to execute it from whatever directory you want, you can:__

  -Move the downloaded file to you /home directory__
  -Go to your /home directory__
  -Open up .bashrc on your prefered text editor__
  -Add the following line: alias bad_advice=~/bad_advice_rs__

Now you don't need to go to the directory every time you want to execute it.
