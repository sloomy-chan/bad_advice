# bad_advice
A terminal-based program made to give you bad advice. That's all. 

This was mainly written as a joke, but also because I wanted something to work on with Rust. It's really simple, but I thought it was funny.
It was made to work on Linux, but I'm sure you could run it from source using Cargo on Linux.

# Instructions
  -Download the latest version under "releases"  
  -Put the file under your /home directory.  
  -Execute it with ```./bad_advice_rs```  

However, if you want to execute it from whatever directory you want, you can:  

  -Move the downloaded file to you /home directory  
  -Go to your /home directory  
  -Open up .bashrc on your prefered text editor  
  -Add the following line: ```alias bad_advice=~/bad_advice_rs```  

Now you don't need to go to the directory every time you want to execute it.
